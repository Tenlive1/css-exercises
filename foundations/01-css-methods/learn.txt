What i learn is that im able to connect css externally by making a style.css which will connect what i put in css to html externally

i have also learn how to do css internally by making style in head and just like it did externally i did it internally

and finally i learn how to style inline which doesn't look good when reading it

the CSS that i have used so far

background-color - change the background color
color - change the text color
font-size
text-align
font-weight - which will increase the boldness

also i learn how to link the external css to the html by using link
